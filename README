The layout of files follows the following scheme:
---

/test 
Contains early versions of golden models and interfaces that were used to 
refine and test the functional specification as it was developed

/src
Contains the actual implementation, golden models, testbenches and stim files
for the bitcoin project

    /interfaces
     Interface files used throughout the DUT

    /shared
     Shared SV files common to the design, such as flip-flops

    /implementation
     DUT SV files that implement most of the non-ShaCore functionality

    /shacore
     DUT SV files that implement the ShaCore functionality

    /gold
     Golden models for our design. golden_bcminer.sv is the main goldem model

    /test
     Testbench files

    bcminer.sv
    The main module for our bitcoin miner

    top.sv
    The top file for our design; used for testing

    config.ini
    The configuration file for our testbench suite

    code_coverage.txt
    The code coverage report

/doc 
Contains the documentation that covers the various aspects of design, 
testing and use

/reference
Contains a C implementation of customized reference implementation of a bitcoin miner that 
calculates intermediate values for the processes for initial verification of the golden models
and bitcoin implementation

CALCULATIONS
Desribes some of the decisions that guided design in terms of stages, pipeline depth, area and 
ultimately performance
