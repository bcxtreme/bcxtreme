The layout of files follows the following scheme:
---

/test 
Contains early versions of golden models and interfaces that were used to 
refine and test the functional specification as it was developed

/src
Contains the actual implementation, golden models, testbenches and stim files
for the bitcoin project

/doc 
Contains the documentation that covers the various aspects of design, 
testing and use

/reference
Contains a C implementation of customized reference implementation of a bitcoin miner that 
calculates intermediate values for the processes for initial verification of the golden models
and bitcoin implementation

CALCULATIONS
Desribes some of the decisions that guided design in terms of stages, pipeline depth, area and 
ultimately performance
